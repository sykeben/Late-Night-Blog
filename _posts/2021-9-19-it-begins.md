# Well, Here We Are!

> \*burp\* *"Well, Morty, looks like we did it."*

Yep, I caved: I am creating a blog. Who knows how often these posts will come about but I'll try to make it daily. Because of that, the style of these posts is going to be, *well*, informal. Imagine it's like a TED talk, but this time pretend the presenter is running on 4 hours of sleep, because they are. That being said, let's get on with it.


## Little Cheat...

Welcome back to life hack corner. But, unlike 5 minute crafts, I teach you things that are actually useful and can't kill you (unless you really try). So, it's 11:30pm on a Sunday night and your MA 165 exam is on Tuesday, what are you going to do? Assuming you have already studied your *butt* off the past couple days and you're currently burning out, you are looking for new little tricks to save yourself some time and regain some sanity.

Here's where a little hack I heard on Reddit this morning comes in. Enter Boilerexams (https://www.boilerexams.com/). It does what it says on the tin: *"This site lets you study like you've never been able to before."* And, gosh dang if that isn't true. While I won't get into the details, to put it in a TL;DR: This site is a godsend. Why don't I just let the creator(s) take it from here. Go ahead, watch their introductory video (https://youtu.be/lyu87H5HImM).


## Jekyll and Mr. Markdown

Fun fact: GitHub pages allows for site generation from Markdown (or in my case: blog posts). So, yeah, forget all the hard effort creating this back-end garbage from scratch, just offload it to Jekyll, a static site generator. Don't believe me, visit their website and see for yourself (https://jekyllrb.com/).


## Catching ZZZs

While it's been fun, unfortunately I must go. It's just part of life (also, I'm tired and I'd like to leave WALC for a while). Until then, stay safe, and BOILER UP!
